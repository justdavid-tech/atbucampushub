Hello, the atbu campus hub website already have the login and sign up pages. But the key questions are that, what are the features one can get access to when they have an account?

secondly, the other question is that, how can they now comment on the posts using the accounts and how can i get the details of the people who create accounts and also login?

Because if you check out the features of the website I want to include, they should all have their profiles too to enable they post their confessions and comments on the posts and also post lost and found items.
